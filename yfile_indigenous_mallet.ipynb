The Canadian news magazine conducts the surveys to gather the opinions of university **faculty** and senior administrators, undergraduate **students** and businesspeople from across Canada. The rankings are the most influential within Canada for students, employers and others considering Canadian universities.\nThe 2023 Reputational Survey is now available for qualified **faculty** and senior administrators to complete and will be open until September 2022. The rankings factor in responses from the 2023 Student Survey, which will **also** be available until September 2022. It polls undergraduate students about their university experience and satisfaction with teaching and learning, mental health services, sexual violence prevention, academic advising, **student** and residence life.\nThe Maclean’s Reputational Survey for Faculty (English version) is available at: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MacleansAcademicSurvey202202.\nThe French-language version of the Reputational Survey is available at: https://fr.surveymonkey.com/r/MacleansSondageEnseignant202202.\nThe Maclean’s Student Survey (English version) is available at: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MacleansStudents202202.\nThe French-language version of the Student Survey is available at: https://fr.surveymonkey.com/r/MacleansEtudiants202201.\n“The Maclean’s University Rankings is an important guide for prospective students who are deciding on where to attend university, and for others looking to assess potential future employees or university partners. It **also** provides important feedback to the University on what we are known for doing well and where there is room for future reputational improvement. I encourage faculty and senior administrators to complete the Reputational Survey to help highlight the groundbreaking work the University is doing and the clear advantages to choosing York,” says Lisa Philipps, provost and vice-**president** academic.\nIndividuals are drawn to York University because they are inspired to drive positive change. York University is taking bold steps to right the future:\n“York’s scholars and researchers are pioneering new ideas and discoveries that are not only enhancing the reputation of our institution but will have a positive change on the communities we serve,” says Amir Asif, vice-**president**, research and innovation. “York is home to Canada’s brightest minds in mathematical modelling for COVID-19, and in fact, our researchers have been instrumental in collaborating with national and international leaders to advise on the trajectory of COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and other parts of the world, including Africa. This will continue to be incredibly important for managing future pandemics and health crises.”\nFrom a research perspective, York University has much to be proud of:\nIn the Maclean’s 2022 University Rankings released in the Fall of 2021, York University was well recognized for advancing its vision to provide a high-quality education at a research-intensive university informed by a clear set of core values. The rankings highlight solid progress in several major areas, including an impressive sixth place ranking against all other comprehensive universities in Canada for the second consecutive year.\nYork’s rankings were also up in key priority areas, including the national Reputation category, where the University climbed two spots to 18 out of 49. The Reputation score is comprised of the following three categories, and York showed improvements over the last year in all of them:\nThe University **community** is tackling complex global issues and preparing students for long-term success. This commitment is reflected in the Student Satisfaction section (Comprehensive University category), where there were noteworthy achievements in the 2022 rankings, with York up two spots in the Mental Health Services category, up three spots in Promoting Indigenous Identity and up five spots in Steps to Prevent Sexual Assault.\n\n\n"

The ministry **also** held out the prospect of further funding in the following two years, based on results.\nThe plan is to enhance and expand services for current aboriginal **students**, including peer mentoring, laptop lending, writing support and **student** leadership; to attract more aboriginal **students** to York through high-school visits by an aboriginal recruiter and to work with high school aboriginal counsellors and advisers; to perform **community** outreach; to develop bridging programs working with service agencies to improve access to York; and to establish an Aboriginal Alumni Association.\nLeft: Lisa Odjig, world champion hoop dancer performing at a powwow held at York\n“These funds will allow York to greatly enhance the support services to the aboriginal **student** population on campus and to develop the necessary resources in place to allow this expansion, such as additional staff and space,” says Randy Pitawanakwat, coordinator of Aboriginal Student Community in the Centre for Student Community & Leadership Development.\nYork plans to use the funds to enhance its youth engagement strategy, such as the Riverdale Project which started in September and gives aboriginal students from Riverdale Collegiate Institute the opportunity to take a York University course and receive a credit toward future studies. \nThe successful recruitment of aboriginal learners often hinges on the involvement of agencies and **community** centres, as well as schools, and this is another area York will concentrate on developing. In addition, as campus visits and viewbooks have been shown to be more influential with aboriginal students than for the non-aboriginal population, York will make more use of those strategies. \nAlready, there are a growing number of York-affiliated people and programs working in aboriginal communities and with aboriginal agencies. There are **also** many representatives of aboriginal communities and agencies who attend cultural events at York – especially the annual powwow – and who give their time and expertise to enrich the experience of aboriginal learners. \nThese connections attract students, help retain them and add to their satisfaction and success, says Pitawanakwat. \nRight: Derrick Bressette, head male dancer at the annual pow wow held at York\nThe goal is to provide continued funding for an aboriginal recruitment officer and other staffing positions that would allow for further aboriginal initiatives at York, such as strengthening community ties, promoting York to potential students and being present in the aboriginal community in a significantly improved way. \nMore than 60 per cent of Ontario’s aboriginal population lives in urban areas. Thirty-two per cent lives in Central Ontario, which includes the Greater Toronto Area and where 86 per cent of York’s aboriginal applicants come from. The majority of them self-identify as North American Indian. \nOver the next three years, York will increase the number of aboriginal students applying to and attending the University. In addition to improving access and augmenting its links with the aboriginal community, York hopes to enhance the support services available to aboriginal learners and improve the retention and graduation rates of aboriginal students. As well, a more robust aboriginal community presence will be developed on the campus. \nTo help achieve these goals, York will look at enhancing, improving and developing space for aboriginal students and developing a Web strategy, such as computer literacy programs targeted to meet the needs of aboriginal populations. York also hopes to improve cultural programs, including elders-in-residence, an indigenous speaker series and the Aboriginal Awareness Days and powwow event. Some of the other goals include enhancing aboriginal student leadership and establishing aboriginal student peer health education, among other things.\nThe MTCU’s new consolidated funding approach will use a results-based process where the ministry will track the progress in improving postsecondary education and training outcomes for aboriginal learners. That could mean an additional $400,000 for each of the two subsequent school years – 2010-2011 and 2011-2012.\nThe approach builds on the Aboriginal Education & Training Strategy, as well as investments made through the Reaching Higher Plan’s Access to Opportunities Strategy (aboriginal-specific component), and other special purpose grants targeted to aboriginal postsecondary education initiatives. \nFor more information, contact Randy Pitawanakwat, coordinator of Aboriginal Student Community in the Centre for Student Community & Leadership Development, at ext. 22607 or rpitawan@yorku.ca.\n\n\n"
